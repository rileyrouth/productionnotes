This is an archive of the Production Notes column from **Doctor Who Magazine**.
The column has been written by the showrunners of *Doctor Who* since its
revival -- Russell T Davies (2004-2009, 2023-2025), Steven Moffat (2010-2017),
and Chris Chiball (2017-2023).

These articles were transcribed by [/u/The_Silver_Avenger](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Silver_Avenger/)

page was created by [Riley Routh](https://rileyrouth.com). You can contribute

The author is one of the showrunners listed above (with a few exceptions). The lede
is part of the title of the original Reddit post, if you're pulling from

the front matter.

Below that, put the text, turned into markdown. [Paste to Markdown](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/)
